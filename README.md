# BiasLens — An AI News Transparency and Bias Tracker

## Problem Statement
Nigerians, especially youth and students, consume news and information mainly from blogs, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Many don’t realize when content is biased, clickbait, misleading, or even AI-generated. There's no easy way to detect slant, verify credibility, or understand if a piece of news is emotionally manipulating them.

## Core Solution
BiasLens is a web-based and WhatsApp-integrated AI tool that allows users to paste any headline, news article, or tweet and get a quick analysis on:
- Tone of article (neutral, emotional, fear-based, etc.)
- Bias direction (political, gender, ethnic, etc.)
- Clickbait or manipulative phrasing
- If it's AI-generated or from known fake news sites

## Why It’s Feasible (Hackathon-Ready MVP)
From Today to Saturday:
Build the MVP using:
- Open-source NLP sentiment and bias detection APIs
- Simple web UI or chatbot for text input
- Output color-coded bias reports (e.g., red = highly biased, green = neutral)
Add a dashboard or leaderboard showing most flagged articles or blogs

## Bonus (optional features later)
- Chrome extension to analyze headlines instantly
- Partnership API for schools, blogs, media orgs
